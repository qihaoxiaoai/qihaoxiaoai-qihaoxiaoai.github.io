[{"categories":["ToMe"],"content":"I recently relocated from Normandy Apartments to Park Towers. I first arrived in Madison on a snowy January day, which turned out to be the heaviest snowfall of 2023. I’m very thankful to my roommate, Simo, for picking me up at the bus station.\nBeing quite introverted, I often hesitate to impose on others. Nonetheless, moving can be overwhelmingly cumbersome. My apartment hunt started online, where I fortuitously bumped into Dr. Meng. She hails from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is an alumna of my school. We helped each other out during this transition. I’ve learned that asking for help is easier than I thought—just being straightforward about your needs can simplify relationships greatly. I like this approach; perhaps as a southerner from China, I’m naturally more reserved and sensitive compared to my northern counterparts.\nAfter moving, Hao, Weikang, and I assisted Tianle with his move. This was my first time driving a U-Haul truck in the U.S. We accidentally toppled a trash bin at a self-service gas station, but the elderly attendant was very understanding, and we reimbursed him for the bin. After returning the truck, we went out for sushi. I forgot what one of the dishes was, but I do remember the delightful combination of bell peppers and raw fish—so tasty that I helped myself to several plates.\nSince Tianle’s move to an area near the Madison airport, I’ve returned to commuting alone. I use Google Maps to check bus schedules and enjoy music or introspective thoughts during the ride. Although I don’t have many close friends here, managing things on my own is quite fulfilling.\nI hope to maintain this smooth sailing in both my personal life and research and to keep striving to emulate my role models.\nMadison, WI \\n R.H.\n","description":"","tags":["blogs","talk to myself"],"title":"Moving Reflections","uri":"/posts/20240806/"},{"categories":null,"content":"hello,this is racy\n标题1 标题2 标题3 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 print（‘format’） 你好哇，\n$$ f(x)=\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$\n你\n好\n哇\nThis is a test Figure1. 这是一张照片 This is a figure ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Hello Photographer!","uri":"/posts/hello-world_2/"},{"categories":null,"content":"hello,this is racy\n标题1 标题2 标题3 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 print（‘format’） 你好哇，\n$$ f(x)=\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$\n你\n好\n哇\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Hello World","uri":"/posts/hello-world/"},{"categories":["test"],"content":"","description":"","tags":["blogs","tags"],"title":"你好呀","uri":"/posts/test_template/"}]
